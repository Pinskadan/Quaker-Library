# Quaker-Library
In 2017 I became a member of the library committee of my local Society of Friends (Quaker) Meetinghouse. The projects in this repository include all of the digital copies of every project I do, including the digitization of the entire library card catalog, and a working inventory sheet of each book in the library.
